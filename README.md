- #### Data Visualization
Data Visualization application providing school administrators and students with a web-enabled interface to perform online query on school information, such information as course description, student GPA, course location, instructor name and so on; based on the responses from the users, the application then generates a SQL statement to fetch the data needed; based on the data returned from SQL server, the screen will be refreshed with the requested information shown in a tabular format or as graphical plot. The application will be composed of 3 primary components: Graphical User Interface (GUI), SQL Interface and Graphical Tool depicted

- #### Handwritten Digit Recognition
design and develop one of its popular classification algorithm called kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) to programmatically predict handwritten digits in its digitized format. kNN is supervised based algorithm by majority vote of its neighbors. 

- #### Number-Guessing Game
One participant (as host) is asked to pick a fixed length number (as secret number) and another participant (as game-player) is to guess the chosen number repeatedly. In the beginning of each game, a secret number is first picked by the host with no repeated digits, then repeatedly prompt the “game-player” for a “guess” of the secret number, without repeated digits. In return after each guess, the game-player will be given some feedbacks about the guess. Based on the feedback, the game-player continues to guess until the secret number is correctly guessed or the maximum number of attempts is reached.
